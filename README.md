# Kickstarter Exploratory Data Analysis and Success Prediction
## Abstract

Kickstarter metrics provide a wealth of information that can be used for exploration in the field of data science. Predicting whether a Kickstarter project will be successful at an early stage is an interesting problem. This report aims to assess the various metrics and data that can be collected from Kickstarter's platform and, finally, use the important information to make predictions regarding a Kickstarter project's success or failure. Several classifier methods are used to either classify a project as either success or fail.
